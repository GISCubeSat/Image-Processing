# Image-Processing
A challenge for collecting satellite imagery is that the satellite will be tumbling in space as it orbits the Earth in an LEO polar orbit. Additionally, there is a brief 7-8 minute window for transmitting satellite telemetry down to the Earth, meaning we must increase the efficiency of our processes. Since sending photos down to the Earth is costly, it is crucial that we send down photos of the Earth. The goal of the Image Processing team is to develop program code to filter out images with the Earth in them and then transmit the photos down.
